CME Trading Example
===================


This example shows how one would implement a trading strategy in Hardware.
It uses Maxeler's CME exchange connectors for both Market Data and Order Entry.

The trading strategy implemented is nonsensical and is there to serve as an illustration only.

MaxMPT exchange connectors are available for other exchanges as well including NASDQ and Eurex.

The Exchange connectors are closed source and not available through github.
