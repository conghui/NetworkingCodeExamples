Code Examples
=============

This repository contains examples for networking code.

Note that the included `config.sh` script must be sourced before running any of these examples.

## Dependencies

MaxPower is required by some of these examples and is included as a git submodule within the `lib` directory. This must be compiled before building the example bitstreams.
