Code Examples
=============

This repository contains examples for networking code.

## Dependencies

MaxPower is required by some of these examples and is included as a git submodule within the `lib` directory. This must be compiled before building the example bitstreams.

Building
---------

### Build System Requirements

Our runtime build system is based around fabricate. 
You will need to install it. This can be done using python-pip:

```
python-pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once fabricate is installed, the build scripts should work.
